# File Formats

Crate provides support for three file formats: `Yaml`, `Json` and `Toml`. Whichever one you want to use, and when, should be based on your needs & requirements.

<Tabs items={['Config', 'Yaml', 'Json', 'Toml']}>
    <Tab>
        ## Config

        The config format in Crate is just an extension of Yaml with specific File Settings by default.
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ## Yaml

        **Pros**

        * Common for configuration
        * Readability

        **Cons**

        * Slower than alternatives
        * Less suitable for storing larger amounts of data

        <Callout type="info">
        We recommend using Crate's `Config` format over `Yaml` for configuration files.
        </Callout>
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ## Json

        **Pros**

        * Common for configuration & storage
        * Is very fast, can store larger amounts of data

        **Cons**

        * Readability
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ## Toml

        **Pros**

        * Compromises between Yaml's readability & Json's performance

        **Cons**

        * Not as common as Yaml & Json
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
