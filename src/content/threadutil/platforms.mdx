In order to use ThreadUtil you will need to use a platform adapter. In the install guide we showed you how to download the Bukkit adapter.

## Bukkit

`threadutil-bukkit`
```java
PlatformBukkit(Plugin plugin)
```

Bukkit based servers have a main thread where most game logic executes. `Sync` tasks always execute on the main thread using the Bukkit Scheduler. `Async` tasks are always executed using TheadUtil's thread pool.

## Velocity

`threadutil-velocity`
```java
PlatformVelocity(Plugin plugin, ProxyServer server)
```

Velocity has no "**main**" thread and as such `Sync` and `Async` tasks always execute asynchronously. However, `Async` tasks are still always executed using TheadUtil's thread pool.

## Sponge

`threadutil-sponge`
```java
PlatformSponge(PluginContainer plugin)
```

Sponge servers have a main thread where most game logic executes. `Sync` tasks always execute on the main thread using the Sponge Scheduler. `Async` tasks are always executed using TheadUtil's thread pool.

## Custom

If your platform lacks an adapter you can add the `threadutil-common` module, and create your own platform adapter.

Create a platform adapter by implementing `PlatformAdapter`. Then pass your platform adapter object into the `Scheduler#init(PlatformAdapter platform)` method.
