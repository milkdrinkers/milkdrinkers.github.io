# Introduction

ThreadUtil is a fluent, multiplatform scheduling utility for Minecraft software, providing elegant async/sync runnable chaining. By default it has platform adapters for Bukkit, Spigot, Paper and Velocity.

The library is maintained with three goals in mind: stability, performance and utility. It is tested and works on java **8** and above.

## Terminology

- **Main**/**Main Thread** - ThreadUtil will, when provided by a platform adapter use the platforms **main** game thread to execute synchronous tasks.*
- **Synchronously**/**Sync** - In ThreadUtil this always refers to executing code on the main thread.
- **Asynchronously**/**Async** - In ThreadUtil this always refers to executing code off the main thread.
- **Task** - A task represents a unit of code that is to be executed.
- **Task Queue** - A collection of tasks that will be executed in order.
