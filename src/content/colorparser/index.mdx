# Introduction

ColorParser is a simple utility for easily adding [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) support with [Adventure](https://docs.advntr.dev/index.html) on Spigot and Paper servers. The library is maintained with three goals in mind: stability, performance and utility.

It is tested and works on all Adventure supported Minecraft versions, that is Minecraft **1.7.10** and up!
